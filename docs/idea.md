# Idea

I like games which move very fast and i have to make quick movements while playing.

# Game idea

I am thinking we make a game where it appears the POV of the player is "falling" through obstacles. 

The user must navigate around these obstacles.

# Visuals

For now I'm picturing the obstacles as simple 2d boxes or walls which are "coming at" the user

# Tech

Typescript, Canvas

Single backend to serve all needs

# Context

This exploratory and fun, not production work
